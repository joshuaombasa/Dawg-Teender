This code is a JavaScript program that displays a series of dog images and their descriptions, and allows the user to interact with them by clicking on the "cross" or "like" buttons.
The code imports a "dogs" array from a "data.js" file, which contains information about each dog, including their name, age, avatar image, and bio.
